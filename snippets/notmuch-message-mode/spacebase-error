Hi $0,

We saw that you experienced a server error on Spacebase when attempting to $1. I wanted to let you know that we deployed a fix for that issue, so you should now be able to access $2 without encountering an error.

Please let us know if you continue to experience any issues, or if there's
anything else we can help you with.

Thanks!
